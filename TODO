general
-------

- add man page/readme

cbox.in
-------

- create temp file dir at startup
- maybe more sanity checks for options?
- add options for:
  * virt guests sizing (ram/cpu/disk/swap)
  * shared disk size
  * shared disk partitioning (qdisk/gfs2/clvmd)

- maybe allow rollback? (this could be complicated)

- allow to execute/disable single hooks

- more distro agnostic
- warn about what you are going to do

hooks
-----

- need lots of cleanup for paths/temp files
- make a common function file (see for example ssh usage or gfs2 creation)
- should be more distro agnostic (or prepare for that)
- ssh into all hosts to populate .ssh/known_hosts?

data
----

- generate kickstarts from templates
- use multiether libvirt template or generate one of the fly
