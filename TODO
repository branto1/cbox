general
-------

- add man page/readme

cbox.in
-------

- maybe more sanity checks for options?
- add options for:
  * virt guests sizing (ram/cpu/disk/swap)
  * shared disk size
  * shared disk partitioning (qdisk/gfs2/clvmd)

- maybe allow rollback? (this could be complicated)

- allow to execute/disable single hooks

- more distro agnostic

- use host to install ccs/luci for management?
- enable more than one bridge/interface?
- use real dhcp+dns?

- add help output

hooks
-----

- make hooks respect all cbox options (based on specs)
- make a common function file (see for example ssh usage or gfs2 creation)
- should be more distro agnostic (or prepare for that)

data
----

- generate kickstarts from templates
- use multiether libvirt template or generate one of the fly
