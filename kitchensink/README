- cman_notify:
  we can re-use it as run-parts equivalent to execute
  a series of hooks in /path/to/dir/*
  each hook would perform a very specific operation,
  keeping the bits small and simple to follow
  the envvars exported from cman_notify are visible to all hooks
  and we can use them to drive the scripts (for eg).

- cnode_libvirt_template.in:
  this is the libvirt machine template I use to cat/sed on the fly
  to easily create N guests.
  all guests are configured so that eth always come up with eth0
  (trinks on avoiding udev renaming the interfaces based on mac address)
  and use dhcp to determine both ip and host name
  the dhcp config/bind zone generations are trivial

- knet_node_libvirt_template.in:
  same as above, handles multiple interfaces for redudant ring
