- cman_notify:
  we can re-use it as run-parts equivalent to execute
  a series of hooks in /path/to/dir/*
  each hook would perform a very specific operation,
  keeping the bits small and simple to follow
  the envvars exported from cman_notify are visible to all hooks
  and we can use them to drive the scripts (for eg).
