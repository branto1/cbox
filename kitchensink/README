- cnode_libvirt_template.in:
  this is the libvirt machine template I use to cat/sed on the fly
  to easily create N guests.
  all guests are configured so that eth always come up with eth0
  (trinks on avoiding udev renaming the interfaces based on mac address)
  and use dhcp to determine both ip and host name
  the dhcp config/bind zone generations are trivial

- knet_node_libvirt_template.in:
  same as above, handles multiple interfaces for redudant ring

- host_set/unset
  debug script to set fabbione public ssh key on host and do git clone

random bubbling:

- use host to install ccs/luci for management?
- enable more than one bridge/interface?
- use dhcp+dns?
- use ssh-keygen on the host and distribute .pub on the guests?
